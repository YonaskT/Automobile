# Automobile

This project analyzes data collected from [Autouncle](https://www.autouncle.se/) , one of Europe's leading platforms for used car listings. The goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices based on various features. This model helps identify undervalued or overvalued vehicles, providing valuable insights into the Swedish automobile market.


The dataset used in the project was collected by webscraping [Autouncle](https://www.autouncle.se/).
