# Automobile

This project focuses on analyzing data collected from [Autouncle](https://www.autouncle.se/), one of Europeâ€™s premier platforms for used car listings. 
The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts used car prices based on various key features. By leveraging this model, we can identify undervalued or overvalued vehicles, offering valuable insights into the Swedish automobile market.


The dataset for this project was obtained through web scraping from the [Autouncle](https://www.autouncle.se/) platform.
